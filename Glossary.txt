Class - The class is the factory and the blueprint for an instance
Instance - A constructed object of the class
Type - Indicates the class to which the instance belongs to
Attribute - Any object value: object.Attribute
Method - A "callable attribute" defined in the class

* Classes are "instance factories"
* Classes define an "instance blueprint"
* Instances know to which class they belong ("type")
* Instances can access variables defined in the class

6 Points to Understanding Classes
---------------------------------
1) An instance of a class knows what class it's from
2) Vars defined in the class are available to the instance
3) A method on an instance passes instance as the first argument to the method (named self in the method)
4) Instances have their own data called instance attributes
5) Variables defined in the class are called class attributes
6) When we read an attribute, Python looks for it first in the instance, and then the class
