# Every entity in Python is an object of a particular type
# Every object has attributes some of which are methods

# Here we see an integer is an object and it has attributes

var = 5
print(dir(var))

# The names of the attributes that begin with double underscore are called 
# private or magic attributes. They are usually used internally by Python itself.

# Other attributes of an integer like numerator, real are attributes that return a value
