* A new instance is a ConfigDict(isinstance(obj, ConfigDict))
* A new instance is also a dict(isinstance(obj, dict))
* The filename passed to init is stored in the _filename attribute
* A pre-existing file still exists after constructing a new instance
* A new, not-yet-existing file exists after constructing a new instance
* Bad file path to constructor raises IOError
* Instance dict has correct key/value pairs
* Value with '=' in it has correct value (i.e, '='.split(value)) doesn't split into > 2 pieces
* Good key read from instance returns correct value
* Bad key read from instance raises ConfigKeyError
* Key/value added to instance updates file properly
